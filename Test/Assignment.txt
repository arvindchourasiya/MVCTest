Assignment 1:
Create a new MVC solution and include attached CSS & JS files in it. Install YUICompressor.NET package in to the solution.Write a custom HTTPHandler which would handle all css & js file requests. When a request is made for main.css HTTPHandler should combine all three chrome.css, ie.css and firefox.css in to a single css file and render the combined css in minified format. Depending on the browser HTTPHandler should load respective js file. For example, if we use chrome to load home page, chrome.js should be rendered in the view. Include a mechanism to ensure that the above only do their magic when the application is not in debug mode.
